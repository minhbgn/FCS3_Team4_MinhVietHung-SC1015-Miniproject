# SC1015 Mini Project - *Obesity Level Prediction*
## About
This is a repository for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligience) Mini Project. This project focuses on **predicting obesity level** of different people, based on the dataset [Obesity or CVD risk](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2/data).

## Problem Definition
- Predict the obesity level of a person based on different aspect of their life
- What aspects of people's life has the biggest impact on the risk of being Obsese and suffer from CVD?
- Which model is the best for prediction in this case?

## Model Used
1. Multi-Class Decision Tree
2. Random Forest Classification
3. XGBoost Classification

## Conclusion
